COFF (Common Object File Format) is a standard file format for executable, object code, and DLL files. It is one of multiple executable formats that an OS can recognize.

An operating system when it needs execute a program needs it in a compiled, encoded binary file that it can understand. The format tells the OS:
- where the code and data are
- how to map them into memory
- entry point / starting address location
- permissions for each section(e.g., read-only, executable)

***Key idea: think of coff files as an executable file of a user program. We cannot read it directly as it's encoded in binary, but the operating system knows how to load the coff file and run it***

In Nachos, the user programs you run (e.g., test.coff) are in this COFF format. The Nachos kernel reads these files and loads them into memory for execution.

 its essentially like the file thats within the executable. for example.... i have testProgram.java, but when it gets ran within Nachos it is read in as a `coff` file, which is essentially encoded binary.

More in depth:
1. `UserProcess.java` is kernel code, it runs in Nachos and it's written in java so i can edit and understand core OS functionality(memory management, syscalls, process control)
2. The user program `test.coff`. is an encoded version of something like `test.java`, however its converted to a `coff` file format so its in the right context for Nachos, the simulated OS, to run. Nachos executes it via simulated MIPS architecture Similar in CSE 105 with the idea of [[2 - Encoding#Encoding TMs|encoding]], where we encode data to fit the context of a problem
When i run something along the lines of 
```
new UserProcess().execute("test.coff");
```
We are essentially telling Nachos "hey kernel, here's a user program in COFF format. Load it into memory, set up the page table, and start running it in user mode."
